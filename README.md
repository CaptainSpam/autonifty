# AutoNifty
An old-school Keenspace/ComicGenesis-style webcomic archive generator, in Python this time

This repository will house my quest to port the old [AutoFox](https://github.com/CaptainSpam/autofox/) script to Python.  No real reason, really, apart from a real-world project to teach myself the basics of Python.  As such, this may wind up being a terribly over-engineered script, but it should still do what I need it to.

A completed version 1 of this should function largely the same to AutoFox, though I'm planning on making a few data file revisions.  For instance, storyline.txt will become JSON, the caption system will probably be simplified to a title-text system, and there'll be some config file cleanup and pruning of options I haven't used in ages.
